Use the read_csv file to read in your data and assign it to a variable called service_data.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
service_data = read_csv(file = "311_Service_Requests_-_Miami-Dade_County.csv")

```

Clean column names of table.

```{r}
service_data <- clean_names(service_data)
colnames(service_data)
```

```{r}
## How many rows and columns are in this data?

nrow(service_data) ## 657544
ncol(service_data) ## 23

```

```{r}
## How many cities are represented in the data?

table(service_data$city) ## 36

```

```{r}
## What is the most frequently occuring issue type?

table(service_data$issue_type) %>%
  as.data.frame() ## 311 ACTIVATION - FPL (POWER LINE DOWN/POWER OUTAGE)

```

```{r}
## Create a dataframe with the frequencies of each Ticket Status and their percentage from the whole. What percentage of tickets have a status of ‘CLOSED’? Name the columns and save the output as a csv titled ticket_status.csv

table(service_data$ticket_status)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
